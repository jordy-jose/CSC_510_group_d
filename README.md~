a. Common base: <br />
<p> Solution 3 (Enchancing the existing Tool) requires the Tool to have the data of the user i.e. existing enrollments, past enrollments and grades. Currently Solution3 is providing these contextual details beforehand, we can if required, utilize the database module of Solution2 to mock this behavior.  </p>
b. Code for the three solutions: <br />

[Solution2] (https://github.com/jordy-jose/CSC_510_group_d/tree/master/Solution%202/MyTrackerApp) <br />
[Solution3] (https://github.com/jordy-jose/CSC_510_group_d/tree/master/Solution3) <br />

7. Evalution plan:
<p>
We plan to evaluate all the three solutions by observing users of the 3 solutions and getting feedbacks. Feedbacks can be either through surveys or through the logs generated by the system.
</p>

<p>
The target audience for the 3 solutions would be fellow students in grad school. We could ask them to follow certain guidelines while using the solutions to accomplish specific tasks or to play around with it. Then we can get their feedback through questionnaire about different aspects of the 3 solutions. For instance, usefulness, ease of use etc. Sample questions could be: did you find the number of seminars you have taken so far, do you know where certain requirements are. Also, we plan to include in our surveys questions which can help us decide if any one particular solution was better than the other for a particular feature. Our aim being, trying to find all the features the user likes and concluding to an extent what would qualify as a better GradTool than the existing tool.
