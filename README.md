a. Common base: <br />
<p> Solution 3 (Enchancing the existing Tool) requires the Tool to have the data of the user i.e. existing enrollments, past enrollments and grades. Currently solution3 is providing these contextual details beforehand, we can if need be, utilize the database module of solution 3 to do the same.  </p>
b. Code for the three solutions: <br />
[Solution1] (https://github.com/jordy-jose/CSC_510_group_d/tree/master/Solution1) <br />
[Solution2] (https://github.com/jordy-jose/CSC_510_group_d/tree/master/Solution%202/MyTrackerApp) <br />
[Solution3] (https://github.com/jordy-jose/CSC_510_group_d/tree/master/Solution3) <br />

Evalution plan:
<p>
We plan to evaluate all the three solutions by conducting a study which will include and will not be limited to users using the solutions and taking surveys.  </p>
<p>
Our user group would be fellow students in grad school using the epack currently.  While doing so we would come up certain tasks that they should try to do and rate in the surveys we conduct for each of the solutions the user tries. For example: could you find the number of seminars you have taken so far, do you know where the requirements are. Also, we plan to include in our surveys questions which can help us decide if any one particular solution was better than the other for a particular feature. Our aim being, trying to find all the features the user likes and concluding to an extent what would qualify as a better GradTool than the existing tool. </p>
